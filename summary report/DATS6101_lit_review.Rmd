# Introduction

## Background

Our team was inspired to choose this topic by the very real and personal impact of road safety. Every day, thousands of people get behind the wheel, whether for work, family, or leisure, often without a second thought about the potential dangers. Yet, motor vehicle accidents remain one of the leading causes of accidental deaths in the U.S., affecting not only victims but entire communities. We saw this project as an opportunity to use data analysis to address a critical issue where our findings could contribute to meaningful safety improvements.

The 2022 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset provided a wealth of information, allowing us to explore when, where, and how fatal accidents occur. With nearly 39,000 observations, we aimed to uncover patterns that could inform safer practices and policies. We believe that data, when thoughtfully analyzed, can lead to life-saving changes.

## Literature Review
Understanding the factors contributing to fatal motor vehicle accidents is crucial for developing effective strategies to reduce them. Moosavi et al. (2019) used data such as time, weather, and points of interest to build predictive models, finding these elements to be significant predictors of accidents. Temporal factors, such as specific high-risk periods like summer months, weekends, and late afternoons, have been linked to increased fatalitites(Farmer & Williams, 2005; Weast, 2018). Environmental conditions, including weather and lighting, further influence crash severity. Ariannezhad and Wu (2018) found that combinations of weather and lighting conditions significantly impact injury severity. Additionally, infrastructure and EMS response times play critical roles in accident outcomes. Hosseinzadeh and Kluger (2021) highlighted that faster EMS response times improve outcomes, particularly in cases of full body injury.

## Research Questions
These insights shape our research questions, which explore the influence of temporal, environmental, infrastructural, and EMS-related factors on motor vehicle accidents:

1. How do temporal factors influence the frequency and severity of fatal accidents?

2. What is the relationship between weather and lighting conditions and the occurrence of fatal accidents?

3. How do road conditions (urban vs. rural, road type, and traffic controls) impact the severity of crashes?

4. Are there discernible trends in fatal accidents over time, and are certain regions experiencing changes in fatalities?

5. How does EMS arrival time influence the outcome of fatal crashes, and are quicker response times linked to lower fatality rates?
