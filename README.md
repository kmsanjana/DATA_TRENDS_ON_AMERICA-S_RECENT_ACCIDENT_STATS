# üõ£Ô∏è Dead Ends and Data Trends: A Journey Through America‚Äôs Recent Accident Stats

*An insightful journey into understanding the patterns behind road fatalities in the U.S. and creating actionable insights for a safer future.*

## üöó **Project Overview**
Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of unintentional injury-related deaths in the U.S., claiming thousands of lives each year. In our quest to understand the underlying causes of these fatal accidents, we‚Äôve embarked on a deep exploration of the 2022 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset. This project utilizes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover critical trends and risk factors contributing to fatal crashes across the country.

Through our journey, we aim to expose patterns within **temporal**, **environmental**, and **road-related factors**, with the ultimate goal of proposing strategies to minimize future fatalities and promote safer roads for all.

## üîç **Research Focus**
Our research seeks to answer critical questions that can inform decision-makers about improving road safety. The following are key areas of exploration:

1. **Temporal Factors**: When are fatal accidents most likely to occur? Is there a "rush hour risk" and/or a "the weekend effect"?
2. **Environmental Conditions**: How do weather, lighting, and visibility impact the severity of accidents?
3. **Road & Traffic Control Conditions- Infrastructure**: What role do road types, conditions, and traffic controls play in determining accident outcomes?
4. **Trends Over Time**: Are fatal accidents becoming more or less frequent over the months in certain regions or states?
5. **Emergency Response (EMS)**: Does the speed of emergency response correlate with the likelihood of survival after an accident?

By focusing on these areas, we aim to provide actionable insights to reduce fatalities, optimize traffic management, and improve emergency services.

## üìä **SMART Research Questions**
The backbone of our study lies in answering the following SMART questions:

1. **How do temporal factors (time of day and day of the week) influence the frequency and severity of fatal accidents?**
2. **What is the relationship between weather and lighting conditions and the occurrence of fatal accidents?**
3. **How do road conditions (urban vs. rural, road type, and traffic controls) impact the severity of crashes?**
4. **Are there discernible trends in fatal accidents over time? Has there been an increase or decrease in fatalities in certain regions?**
5. **How does EMS arrival time influence the outcome of fatal crashes, and are quicker response times linked to lower fatality rates?**

This analysis will be helpful for policymakers, city planners, and road safety organizations to drive impactful changes.
